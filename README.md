# features

- Run the HTML file with a live server (recommended VS code liver server extension)
- Enable MetaMask or any other wallet in your browser (use Ethereum mainnet)
- Swapping will be enabled only after a wallet is connected with the DEX
- Clicking on Swap button makes an actual swap with your tokens, users will see an option to reject/approve transaction in their specific wallets
